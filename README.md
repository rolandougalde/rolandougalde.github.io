Welcome! With over 28 years of dedicated experience in IT infrastructure. Proficient in assembling and maintaining hardware and virtual servers, I specialize in all server room essentials, from UPS and AC monitoring to IPv4 networks, Firewalls, TCP/UDP ports, and more. My repertoire includes building and managing Linux and Windows servers for diverse purposes, be it hosting APIs, websites, or general services like a CDN. Skilled in virtual machine orchestration, I am committed to continuous learning, currently honing my web development skills in HTML, CSS, Markdown, JamStack, and various scripting languages. From crafting functional websites to scripting in JavaScript, Python, SQL, PHP, Shell Script, Bash, SQLite and Git. Furthermore, I have successfully completed numerous university courses on DevOps and Docker.
